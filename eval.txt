How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You dope, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute
